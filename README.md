# A simple FiveM AutoPurge system for MySQL not used data.
Just add ensure m93_autopurge to server.cfg

Do not forget to complete the SQL request with yours in m93_autopurge/server/sv_autopurge.lua

Don't forget to make a backup of your SQL Database before use first time (I am not responsible for data loss, it is basically a simple resource that I make for my server).
